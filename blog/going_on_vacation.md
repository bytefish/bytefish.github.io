summary: Moving the Page.

We are on vacation at the Sunny Beach in Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and, as the name implies, it’s very sunny in here.

It’s quite hard to keep two five year old girls entertained, when the sun has to be avoided… to not melt. Thanks to 小猪佩奇 I have an hour off in the afternoon (they are watching Peppa Pig in Mandarin).

So I’ve moved this domain to Hetzner as a Domain Registrar (Cloudflare doesn’t offer a .de TLD) and the page is now served using GitHub Pages. This is going to reduce my costs by *a lot*. 

I got rid of bytefish.dev, bytefish.net and bytefish.org. I have registered them back in the days, but they have been too pricy. So let domain grabbers pay for and enjoy them!

I've also deleted my Mastodon account, because I think any social media, wether it's dictated by algorithms or not, is a boring echo chamber.
