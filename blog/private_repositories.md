summary: An update message. 

The traffic to this site has gradually decreased due to LLMs. Google is now de-ranking the page, because according to its Search Console it’s not "fresh" content. Cool! And on top I have been crawled to death by thousands of AI startups.

So I have put most of my repositories into private mode. Why? Simply because I don’t want to feed LLM training sets anymore, see my tutorials and code copied verbatim without proper attribution... and then get de-ranked by these companies for not providing "fresh" content.

If you need access to any of the repositories, I am more than happy to share the code. But it’s going to take at least a mail or an issue in this page issue tracker, so I know theres genuine interest. 

My mail address is pwag86 *AT* gmail *DOT* com, the Issue Tracker on this page’s GitHub repository has been enabled again.
